# tictactoe-hs
TicTacToe in Haskell.

`stack install` to build and install `ttt` executable.  Remember to set an alarm.  You can't afford another TicTacToe all-nighter and you know it.

I've English'd this program, the walkthrough can be found [here](https://github.com/deciduously/tictactoe-hs/blob/master/in-english.md)
